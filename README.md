# Here we go:

## Alpha

Outperformance vs the beta (market average)

_"Free alpha: buy X"_

## Aped

This one has come straight from Crypto Twitter.   It means "take on a large position relative to one's own portfolio size"

Apes have a strong NFT history - first, the famous 24 ape punks and then with Bored Ape Yacht Club.

"I aped Golden Snail, but DYOR"

## Few

Few is short for "few understand".  Like "probably nothing" it is polite FOMO.

_"MOMA bought a punk. Few"_

## FUD



## gmi / wagmi / ngmi

Gonna make it / We're all gonna make it / Not gonna make it

_"MOMA just bought a punk.  WAGMI"_

## gm

Good morning. 

_"gm"_

## LFG

Let's F***ing Go.   Used when you are excited about something.   Best used with rocket emojis.

_"New Golden Snail mint. LFG ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€"_

## Noob/Pleb

Newbie and Plebian.  The opposite of OG.  The polite way to use these terms is only about yourself.

_"6529 is such a noob.  I can't believe I forgot to mint the Golden Snail"_

## Ser

Affectionate term for Sir. 

_"But Ser, wen token launch?"_

## Wen

When, but you don't have time to type the h.
